array = ["fast", "faster", "fastest"]
fast, faster, fastest are called elements of an array

array = [
    {
        "Type" = "Car",
        "Color" = "Dark Blue 
    }
]
when we use "{}" in array it means that it is object and object always contains in key value pairs, which means in this case: "Type" is key and "Car" is value
